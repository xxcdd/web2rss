      <description>LibreNMS Authenticated RCE module and ESC15 improvements
This week the Metasploit Framework was blessed with an authenticated RCE module
in LibreNMS, an autodiscovering PHP/MySQL-based network monitoring system. An
authenticated attacker can create dangerous directory names on the system and
alter sensitive configuration parameters through the web portal. These two
defects combined to allow arbitrary OS commands inside shell_exec() calls, thus
achieving arbitrary code execution.

      <description>ESC4 Detection
This week, Metasploit’s jheysel-r7  updated the
