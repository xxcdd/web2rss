      <description>August 28, 2025The Cognition TeamBuild Your Own AI Data AnalystOur #analytics Slack channel looks completely different than it did a year ago. Like most companies, we used to struggle with analytics. Even seemingly simple questions like "Why is enterprise plan revenue spiking for this cohort?" led to ping chains of doom.

Getting answers often took days or weeks. Now, it takes minutes. What changed? We trained our own 24/7 on-demand data scientist.</description>

      <title>Windsurf Codemaps: Understand Code, Before You Vibe It</title>
      <link>https://cognition.ai/blog/codemaps</link>
      <description>November 4, 2025The Cognition TeamWindsurf Codemaps: Understand Code, Before You Vibe ItCodemaps is meant to offer a shared understanding of a system between humans and AI, enabling your AI to teach you about the code you are looking at quickly and elegantly.  A codemap can be generated about any system or snippet to illuminate its code paths, helping users learn and recall. Codemaps allows AI to be a partner that explains code in an accurate and consistent way, rather than generating tons of inscrutable slop.</description>
