      <title>Introducing XBOW</title>
      <link>https://xbow.com/blog/introducing-xbow/</link>
      <description>XBOW brings AI to offensive security. Today we’re announcing the results of testing XBOW on hundreds of web security benchmarks. Without any human intervention, XBOW correctly finds and exploits the vulnerabilities in most of them.</description>

      <title>Breaking Crypto with XBOW</title>
      <link>https://xbow.com/blog/breaking-crypto-with-xbow/</link>
      <description>When I taught Offensive Security at NYU, padding oracles were the hardest attack we covered in our two-week unit on breaking cryptography. So it shocked me when XBOW managed to successfully build an exploit for this vulnerability in one of our novel benchmarks “Bad Captcha”, using it to decrypt a cookie set by the server and bypass its authentication.</description>

      <title>XBOW now matches the capabilities of a top human pentester</title>
      <link>https://xbow.com/blog/xbow-vs-humans/</link>
      <description>Five professional pentesters were asked to find and exploit the vulnerabilities in 104 realistic web security benchmarks. The most senior of them, with over twenty years of experience, solved 85% during 40 hours, while others scored 59% or less. XBOW also scored 85%, doing so in 28 minutes. This illustrates how XBOW can boost offensive security teams, freeing them to focus on the most interesting and challenging parts of their job.</description>
