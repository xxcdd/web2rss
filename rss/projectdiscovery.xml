      <description>Weâ€™re excited to share that ProjectDiscovery has been named one of the Top 10 Finalists in the 2025 RSA Innovation Sandbox! On Monday, April 28, weâ€™ll take the stage at RSA Conference in San Francisco to showcase how weâ€™re rethinking vulnerability management from the ground up with speed, accuracy, and the power of open-source.

      <title>Solving Vulnerability Management: ProjectDiscoveryâ€™s RSA Innovation Sandbox Win</title>
      <link>https://projectdiscovery.io/blog/solving-vulnerability-management-projectdiscovery-rsa-innovation-sandbox-win</link>
      <description>Last week, ProjectDiscovery took home the title of Most Innovative Startup at the 2025 RSA Innovation Sandbox, the biggest stage in the world for security innovation. While much of this yearâ€™s buzz centered on securing AI, our win was a powerful signal: even as new frontiers emerge, foundational problems like vulnerability management remain unsolved. Security leaders are still spending millions on tools that generate noise instead of insight, and the industry is ready for a better way.

      <title>Bug Bounty Etiquette: More than Ethical Hacking (part one)</title>
      <link>https://projectdiscovery.io/blog/bug-bounty-etiquette-more-than-ethical-hacking-part-one</link>
      <description>This is part one of our two-part series on polite hacking, focusing on what to do. Part two talks about what not to do (link coming soon).Â 

This blog is not about techniques. Itâ€™s not about tools to use, how to find the vulnerability, or anything like that. There are plenty of those out there. Itâ€™s much more like an etiquette guide for Bug Bounty reporting, and how working within these social norms can lead to better outcomes for you in your career! Think of it like a cotillion class, or the fa</description>

      <description>This is the second part of our series on bug bounty etiquette. Part one looks at what you should be doing.Â 

Last month we talked about bug bounty etiquette and how to be a good bug bounty hunter; not in the sense of finding more bugs, but rather in how to be the kind of bug bounty hunter people want to work with. This time, we have some advice about what NOT to while bug bounty hunting. Let's get started.

 1. Donâ€™t go all out
 2. Donâ€™t ignore the rules
 3. Donâ€™t report unnecessary stuff

      <title>Effortless Passive Detection Using Global Matchers in Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://projectdiscovery.io/blog/introducing-global-matchers-in-nuclei</link>
      <description>If you've ever found yourself repeatedly setting up the same matchers in multiple Nuclei templates, it's time to break free from that cycle. Meet global matchers, a killer feature in Nuclei that simplifies your detection workflow.

Imagine having a single template that automatically hunts for specific patterns (like private keys, sensitive tokens, or webhooks) across every HTTP response from all your other templates. That's what global matchers do â€” and they do it effortlessly.

      <title>CVE-2025-4427/4428 : Ivanti EPMM Remote Code Execution - Technical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://projectdiscovery.io/blog/ivanti-remote-code-execution</link>
      <description>Introduction

As security researchers, we all know that familiar dance when blackbox testing web apps and APIs. You poke an endpoint, get hit with "blah parameter is missing" or "blah is of the wrong type," and after satisfying every requirement, you're often met with the frustrating 401 or 403. That feeling of being so close, yet so far, is something we've all experienced.

However, in a recent analysis of Ivanti EPMM's CVE-2025-4427 and CVE-2025-4428 , this very flow of execution â€“ validation</description>
