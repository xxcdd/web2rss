      <title>Bug Bounty Etiquette: More than Ethical Hacking (part one)</title>
      <link>https://projectdiscovery.io/blog/bug-bounty-etiquette-more-than-ethical-hacking-part-one</link>
      <description>This is part one of our two-part series on polite hacking, focusing on what to do. Part two talks about what not to do (link coming soon).Â 

This blog is not about techniques. Itâ€™s not about tools to use, how to find the vulnerability, or anything like that. There are plenty of those out there. Itâ€™s much more like an etiquette guide for Bug Bounty reporting, and how working within these social norms can lead to better outcomes for you in your career! Think of it like a cotillion class, or the fa</description>

      <description>This is the second part of our series on bug bounty etiquette. Part one looks at what you should be doing.Â 

Last month we talked about bug bounty etiquette and how to be a good bug bounty hunter; not in the sense of finding more bugs, but rather in how to be the kind of bug bounty hunter people want to work with. This time, we have some advice about what NOT to while bug bounty hunting. Let's get started.

 1. Donâ€™t go all out
 2. Donâ€™t ignore the rules
 3. Donâ€™t report unnecessary stuff

      <title>Effortless Passive Detection Using Global Matchers in Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://projectdiscovery.io/blog/introducing-global-matchers-in-nuclei</link>
      <description>If you've ever found yourself repeatedly setting up the same matchers in multiple Nuclei templates, it's time to break free from that cycle. Meet global matchers, a killer feature in Nuclei that simplifies your detection workflow.

Imagine having a single template that automatically hunts for specific patterns (like private keys, sensitive tokens, or webhooks) across every HTTP response from all your other templates. That's what global matchers do â€” and they do it effortlessly.
