      <title>Bug Bounty Etiquette: More than Ethical Hacking (part one)</title>
      <link>https://projectdiscovery.io/blog/bug-bounty-etiquette-more-than-ethical-hacking-part-one</link>
      <description>This is part one of our two-part series on polite hacking, focusing on what to do. Part two talks about what not to do (link coming soon).Â 

This blog is not about techniques. Itâ€™s not about tools to use, how to find the vulnerability, or anything like that. There are plenty of those out there. Itâ€™s much more like an etiquette guide for Bug Bounty reporting, and how working within these social norms can lead to better outcomes for you in your career! Think of it like a cotillion class, or the fa</description>

      <description>This is the second part of our series on bug bounty etiquette. Part one looks at what you should be doing.Â 

Last month we talked about bug bounty etiquette and how to be a good bug bounty hunter; not in the sense of finding more bugs, but rather in how to be the kind of bug bounty hunter people want to work with. This time, we have some advice about what NOT to while bug bounty hunting. Let's get started.

 1. Donâ€™t go all out
 2. Donâ€™t ignore the rules
 3. Donâ€™t report unnecessary stuff

      <description>Introduction

In our last blog post, we delved into the inner workings of Lucee and took a look at the source code of Masa/Mura CMS, and the vastness of the potential attack surface struck us. It became evident that investing time in understanding the code could pay off. After dedicating a week to our exploration, we stumbled upon several entry points for exploitation, including a critical SQL injection flaw that we were able to exploit within Apple's Book Travel portal.
